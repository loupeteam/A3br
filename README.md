# Description
ABB provides a REST API for interfacing with its robots, called Robot Web Services. This library implements an HTTP client to handle communication between a B&R PLC and an ABB IRCâ€™s Robot Web Services server. It thereby provides read and write access to a wide range of settings and parameters on the IRC, as ABB has exposed most of its inner workings via this API. 

# Use Cases
Many different types of process-level communication between the two systems are possible using this library:

*Retrieve the current state of the IRC (RAPID state, program execution state, etc)
*Read/write the value of an IO signal on the IRC
*Read/write the value of a data symbol (i.e. RAPID var) on the IRC
*Control program execution (start, stop, reset PP)

# Installation
To install using the Loupe Package Manager (LPM), in an initialized Automation Studio project directory run `lpm install a3br`
